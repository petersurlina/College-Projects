# Cruise Directory Project
------------------------------
A cruise directory project that I created for an object-oriented programming class I took in my Junior year of college. This project utilizes Java alongside the JavaFX library to create a user interface for creation, removal, storing, and updating of a cruise line's potential fleet and passenger listings. To create the GUI I utilized SceneBuilder's drag-and-drop interface to  implement elements, images, and pass information to the user when requested.

### UML Overview


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests
